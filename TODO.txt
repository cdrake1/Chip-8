TODO

1. no output when running in browser (ERROR IS DUE TO PATH NOT BEING READ PROPERLY FOR ROM)
2. Cpu cycle appears to be functioning correctly as multiple instructions are being called
3. Consider adding console.log("InstructionName" executed correctly) to every instruction to see which instructions are functioning correctly or not
4. Consider organizing random files such as c, package.json,etc into folders

--Update-- Collin

- I attempted to add html to grab an input file from the user and then pass that to system
which would then load it into memory. 
- This did not work and html is saying it doesnt know what the function I called is. Will look again tomorrow


-- server.js needs to connect to system somehow...

--Update Christian--
Fixed The document and window errors being thrown by the keyboard and monitor
Also fixed one missing instruction. One still remains undone.
The only errors being thrown now by the server have to do with the ROM being improperly READ
I have not messed around with pausing the system until the rom is read properly. that might be a good idea
Goodluck.
