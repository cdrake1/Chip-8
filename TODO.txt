TODO
1. Need default sprites to exist in memory and a function to load them. refer to Cowgod 2.4 for list [DONE]

2. keyboard needs to be built out (I already inputted the basic key layout) It needs functions to operate [Done but need to test]

3. CPU MOSTLY DONE. Need help with three instructions which rely on the keyboard. (marked them) [done?]

4. Find a way to run a local server for testing (maybe using npm express?)

5. read note at the bottom of index.ts

6. speaker needs to be made

7. monitor needs to be fixed


------IMPORTANT--------

It looks like the reason we are getting errors for the monitor and now the keyboard is because 
objects like document and window are used for browser based code while node.js is a server side langauge environment that
doesnt contain these in its language. So running npm start will casue these errors to throw. We need to find a way to run this code in the web browser
