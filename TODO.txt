TODO

6. speaker needs to be made [started]

9. figure out how to host/run code through a browser

7. monitor needs to be fixed

8. keyboard needs to be fixed

9. test


------IMPORTANT--------

It looks like the reason we are getting errors for the monitor and now the keyboard is because 
objects like document and window are used for browser based code while node.js is a server side langauge environment that
doesnt contain these in its language. So running npm start will casue these errors to throw. We need to find a way to run this code in the web browser
