Update
Currently Memory and reading in the ROM is the MAIN ISSUE
I believe I fixed the code so that the system does NOT run until the memory has been loaded
HOWEVER, I can not get the memory to properly load, I believe this to be because of one of two issues or
maybe both issues.
I confirmed that the switch is correctly reading in the opcodes by console.log"Found" showing it finds 0x0000 as 0000.

1. The Program Counter is not accurately pulling the correct location in general memory HENCE the opcode -
0000 which indicates its pulling from empty memory furhter ahead in the general memory.
2. The Hexidemical is not correctly being read into the general memory, I believe this could be the case
because when inspecting the logos.ch8 file using a binary viewer, the hexidemical printed in the console
do not align with the ones from the viewer.

ADDED c dev, which utilizes nodemon, which will be very useful for us when we can get the memory loaded.
Nodemon constantly resets the server when you click cntrl S to save a file, so you can actively check your
changes without having to constantly run C.bat. However it doesnt work if the program crashes, so it isnt
of much use to us now.
