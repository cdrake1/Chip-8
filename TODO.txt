TODO

6. speaker needs to be made [added comment in speaker and added sound function in cpu]

9. figure out how to host/run code through a browser (node's express could work?)

7. monitor needs to be fixed

8. keyboard needs to be fixed [Missing a function to finish cpu instructions -> see keyboard note]

9. test


------IMPORTANT--------

It looks like the reason we are getting errors for the monitor and now the keyboard is because 
objects like document and window are used for browser based code while node.js is a server side langauge environment that
doesnt contain these in its language. So running npm start will casue these errors to throw. We need to find a way to run this code in the web browser
