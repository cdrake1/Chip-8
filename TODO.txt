TODO

1. no output when running in browser (ERROR IS DUE TO PATH NOT BEING READ PROPERLY FOR ROM)
2. Cpu cycle appears to be functioning correctly as multiple instructions are being called
3. Consider adding console.log("InstructionName" executed correctly) to every instruction to see which instructions are functioning correctly or not
4. Consider organizing random files such as c, package.json,etc into folders
